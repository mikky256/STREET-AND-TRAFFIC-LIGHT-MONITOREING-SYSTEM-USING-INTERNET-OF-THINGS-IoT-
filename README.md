# STREET-AND-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-MONITOREING-SYSTEM-USING-INTERNET-OF-THINGS-IoT-
This project uses IoT to monitor and control street and traffic lights. Built with C# on the .NET Framework, it features Arduino Nano boards, HC-12 transceivers, and sensors for automated lighting based on the time of day. The system enables remote monitoring, improving energy efficiency and traffic safety.
